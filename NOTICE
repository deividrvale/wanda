WANDA is a tool for proving or disproving higher-order termination.
It was created by Cynthia Kop as part of the HOT (Higher-Order
Termination) project from the VU University Amsterdam, which was
supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research
(NWO-EW) under grant 612.000.629.

Full documentation of the techniques used in WANDA 2.2 is given in the
paper "WANDA -- a Higher Order Termination Tool" by Cynthia Kop, a
pre-editing copy of which is included in this release.  The details
of the techniques largely appear in the PhD thesis "Higher-Order
Termination" by Cynthia Kop.  Citations to additional theory are
provided by the tool when used.

As back-ends, WANDA uses:
* a sat-solver (resources/satsolver): this is the open-source tool
  MiniSat, which is available from http://minisat.se
  (MIT licence)
* a first-order termination prover (resources/firstorderprover): this
  is the open-source tool NaTT, which is available from
  https://www.trs.css.i.nagoya-u.ac.jp/NaTT/
* a small script to timeout external calls when they take too long:
  this is the script timeout, which is available from
  http://www.odi.ch/prog/timeout.php

In addition, a non-termination prover may be used, which returns an
explicit counterexample when returning NO; as no open-source tool is
available which outputs the specific format that Wanda requires, no
such back-end is included in the current release.

Both the sat-solver and the termination prover can be replaced by
other tools, provided these tools satisfy the formats of the
corresponding competitions.  The timeout script, too, can be
replaced by any tool with the same interface.  More information about
those external tools can be found in resources/NOTICE.

All licences are available in the licences/ directory.  WANDA itself
is released under the Apache licence.

If the executables do not work, then you should be able to compile
WANDA from the source by typing "make" in the main directory.  To
get the back-ends compiled, see the relevant information in
resources/NOTICE.
